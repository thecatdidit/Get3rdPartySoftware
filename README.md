# 3rd Party Software Downloader

## Project: 
  - This is part of my <b>MDT automation Project</b>

## What it does:
The script crawls through the 3rd party websites, looking for specific tags in the html and auto navigates to find the download link. Then it will download the files and store them in a folder. Once downloaded, it will build a Cixml that can be imported with another script (https://github.com/PowerShellCrack/MDTApplicationUpdater) to automaticaly updates MDT.

## Works on:
 - Currently it only updates wsf files (https://github.com/PowerShellCrack/MDTDeployApplications) 
 NOTE: The wsf file must contain the variable: <b>sVersion</b>
